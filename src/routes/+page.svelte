Hello, Iâ€™m Erin, an undergraduate computer science student. 

My main interests are in user-focused design, such as front-end development, UI/UX design, etc. I also have a game design hobby, due to enjoying creation of art, writing, and coding. 

I'm from Seattle, unless you're from Seattle, in which case I am actually from half an hour away
